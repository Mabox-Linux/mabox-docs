Installation (Arch/Manjaro/Mabox):

```
yay python-pip
```

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install mkdocs
python -m pip install mkdocs-material
python -m pip install pymdown-extensions
```

## Preview server
While you are working on the documentation and create new stuff it is often necessary to immediately see how it looks like. This is possible if you start an development server of mkdocs using:
```
mkdocs serve # from within the project home
```
This will start a development server which automatically reloads on changes.
