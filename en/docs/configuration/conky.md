Conky in Mabox can be configured by either **Mabox Control Center** or helper menu located in **Settings menu** ++super+s++ -> **Conky**. 
You can also invoke **Conky Settings menu** directly by ++super+alt+k++.

*Conkies* are started in Mabox as *conky-session*, therefore is easy to have multiple Conky started.

To select one or more Conky use **Conky Manager**[^1] ( Settings menu ++super+s++ -> Conky -> Choose conky...)
Mabox provides some Conky configs by default, and you can add your own to `~/.config/conky/`.



Multiple conkys can be run together and saved as a conky session, which is started at login.
There are some predefined sessions containing default two Conky configs colorized differently.


To switch off/on Conky temporarily use ++super+alt+c++.


If you like to disable Conky completly go to **Settings menu** ++super+s++ -> **Autostart** -> **Choose apps/services (GUI editor)**
