Mabox uses two methods of autostart:

- XDG autostart *(with GUI editor)*
- Openbox autostart script - *advanced*


You can easily configure both methods from:

**Main menu** ++super++ -> **Mabox Config** -> **Autostart** â€¦

or quicker from **Settings Menu** ++super+s++.

## Openbox autostart file
For advanced configuration there are user script at `~/.config/openbox/autostart`.

Usually there is no need to edit this file, but advanced users can add their own commands or scripts there.
