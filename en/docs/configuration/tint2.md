## Submenu to configure Tint2 in Mabox
To configure Tint2 panel go to: 

**Settings menu** ++super+s++ -> **Tint2 panels**


## Choosing an alternate configuration

Tint2 panel theme can be changed with the **Tint2 Chooser**[^1] script:


**Settings menu** ++super+s++ -> **Tint2 panels** -> **Choose Tint2...**

Some alternative Tint2 configs are shipped with Mabox, and you can add your own configurations to `~/.config/tint2/`

!!! info "How to add own tint2 config files to Mabox?"
    If you find a nice tint2 config and want to add it to Mabox, just put it into `~/.config/tint2` directory. Remember to save tint2 configs with `.tint2rc` extension. Otherwise they will be not picked by **Tint2 Chooser**.
