**fzf** (*fuzzy finder*) is a general-purpose tool that lets you find files, commands in the history, processes, git commits, and more using a fuzzy search.
Fzf is installed and configured by default in Mabox as well as several other tools utilizing it.

The following key bindings are configured:

- ++ctrl+t++ - Paste the selected files and directories onto the command-line  (e.g., type `git add` , press ++ctrl+t++, select a few files using ++tab++, finally ++enter++)
- ++ctrl+r++ - Paste the selected command from history onto the command-line
- ++alt+c++ - cd into the selected directory
