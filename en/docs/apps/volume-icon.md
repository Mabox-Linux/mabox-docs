**Volume icon** is lightweight volume control for the system tray.

It is installed but disabled by default in Mabox, because there are other ways to control sound volume configured:

- ++super+v++ is a key bind for **pavucontrol**
- multimedia keys  ++"XF86AudioRaiseVolume"++ and ++"XF86AudioLowerVolume"++ are preconfigured and should work

If you like to enable Volume Icon use XDG Autostart Editor:
**Main menu** -> **Mabox Config** -> **Autostart** -> **Choose apps/services (GUI editor)** to enable it.
