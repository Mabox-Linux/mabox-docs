Being a *rolling-release* distribution *based* on Manjaro **stable branch** - Mabox gets updates approximately every 2 to 4 weeks.

By default pamac-applet is running in system tray, so you will be informed about any available updates.

Conky will also show available updates.



<div class="gal1">
    <a href="../../img/available-updates.jpg" title="Updates notifications"><img src="../../img/available-updates.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>

Before performing an update, it is a good idea to have a look at [the official announcement](https://forum.manjaro.org/c/announcements/stable-updates/12) on the Manjaro forum. 

You can use Pamac - graphical package manager to perform the update or just run it in a terminal: 
```
yay
```
